Web Development applications.

"homepage" is my first Web application developed for the Harvard course CS50 Introduction to Computer Scince. The main idea of the page was 
to get familiar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, I had the challenge of implemeting one or more of the following features:
  
  * Utilize Bootstrap library
  * Create at least one style sheet(CSS file)
  * Integrate one or more features of JavaScript
  * Ensure that your site looks nice on browsers
